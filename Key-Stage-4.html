		<h2>Component 01:<BR>Computer systems</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Introduces students to the central processing unit (CPU), computer memory and storage, data representation, wired and wireless networks, network topologies, system security and system software. It also looks at ethical, legal, cultural and environmental concerns associated with computer science.</p>
		<p>50%</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Component 02:<BR>Computational thinking, algorithms and programming</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Students apply knowledge and understanding gained in component 01. They develop skills and understanding in computational thinking: algorithms, programming techniques, producing robust programs, computational logic and translators.</p>
		<p>50%</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Practical programming</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Students are to be given the opportunity to undertake a programming task(s) during their course of study which allows them to develop their skills to design, write, test and refine programs using a high-level programming language. Students will be assessed on these skills during the written examinations, in particular component 02 (section B).</p>

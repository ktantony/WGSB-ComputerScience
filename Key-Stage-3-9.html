		<h2>Term 1<br>Layers of Computing</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Learners explore how computing systems work—from software and operating systems to hardware and binary. The unit simplifies complex ideas and ends with discussions on AI and open-source software, linking modern topics to core concepts.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Term 2<br>Data Representation</h2>
		<br>
		<p>GCSE Prep – Computer Systems & Security (OCR J277 1.2.3 & 1.2.4)
This unit covers six topics plus an assessment, aligned with the OCR J277 spec. It introduces key concepts in computer systems and security, with flexible lesson timing based on depth and homework review.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Term 3<BR>Python Next Steps</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Building on prior experience, pupils revisit core Python skills before exploring loops, lists, and functions. They learn modular programming and develop confidence through iterative testing. This unit prepares learners for GCSE Computing and helps confirm their interest in the subject.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Term 4</br>Computational Thinking</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Pupils explore problem-solving through unplugged activities, learning key concepts like logic gates, decomposition, and network topology. They apply computational thinking with paper-based and digital tasks, including a Scratch activity. The unit ends with an assessment and introduces modern computing ideas in an engaging, accessible way.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Term 5<br>Spreadsheets Modelling</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Pupils create and format financial models using Excel, revisiting core skills and learning advanced features like SUM, IF, COUNTIF, conditional formatting, validation, charting, and macros. They model TV show income, merchandising, and seating plans, exploring “what if” scenarios.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Term 6<br>AI and Machine Learning</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Pupils explore AI concepts, history, and ethics before applying theory in Scratch projects. They adapt programs for image detection, chatbots, and review analysis using lists and subroutines. Activities are accessible and support both online and paper-based learning</p>
